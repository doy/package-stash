Revision history for Package-Stash

{{$NEXT}}

0.18  2011-01-03
      - non-trial release

0.17-TRIAL  2011-01-03
      - use Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Conflicts rather than doing it by hand
      - silence deprecation warnings for the method renaming for now

0.16-TRIAL  2010-12-31
      - use Dist::CheckConflicts

0.15-TRIAL  2010-11-16
      - split the XS conversion out to its own dist (Package-Stash-XS), and
        convert Package::Stash into a module which loads either the XS or pure
        perl implementation, depending on what's available

0.14-TRIAL  2010-11-14
      - complete rewrite in C, for speed (this includes the vivification
        changes from earlier). should be entirely backwards compatible
        otherwise (in terms of documented api anyway).

      - methods were renamed for brevity: s/_package//

0.13  2010-10-31
      - revert the vivification changes for now, to get an actual release out
        with Test::Fatal

0.12-TRIAL  2010-10-27
      - actually include the conflict stuff in the release (bah)

0.11-TRIAL  2010-10-27
      - conflict on mx-role-withoverloading too

0.10-TRIAL  2010-10-27
      - only do the weird ISA special-casing on perl versions where it's broken

0.09-TRIAL  2010-10-27
      - clean up the vivication code a lot, make it behave more sanely
      - use Test::Fatal instead of Test::Exception (Justin Hunter)

0.08  2010-09-18
      - oops, accidentally included some experimental changes in that last
        release, that break things

0.07  2010-09-18
      - non-dev release

0.06-TRIAL  2010-08-26
      - re-enable the caching of the stash, since I can't reproduce the bug
        at all

0.05  2010-06-15
      - bump Test::More requirement for done_testing

      - update packaging stuff

0.04  2010-06-13
      - get_package_symbol now doesn't autovivify stash entries. A new method
        get_or_add_package_symbol can now be used for that behavior.

      - Update %DB::sub on add_package_symbol (Tim Bunce).

0.03  2010-05-14
      - Rename from Stash::Manip to Package::Stash

0.02  2010-05-13
